/*:
 ## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
 - Name: The user's name
 - Age: The user's age
 - Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
 - Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
 - Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours

print("the user name is a constant becuase you cant change no ones name.")
let name = "eric james"
print(name)
print ("the age of the user is a variable because people get older so the age change.")
var age = 25
print(age)
print ("The number of steps taken today is a constant because after today you cant change the number of steps you have taken.")
var stepstakentoday = "2,000"
print (stepstakentoday)
print("the goal number of steps is a constent because that goal cant be changed ")
let goalsteps = "3,000"
print(goalsteps)
print("the average heart rate is a variable because it can change if you run or walk")
var heartrate = "80"
print(heartrate)
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
